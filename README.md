Development of Recommender Systems using Game Theory Techniques

Collaborative Filtering, Content Based Filtering and Demographic Filtering 
recommendation methods modeled as cooperative games. 

Implementation of Hybrid models combining the above methods:
  
  Linear Combination where each of the combined method is a player of a cooperative game.
  
  Use of the top-k players of Collaborative and Demographic Filtering as the initial population
  of a Genetic Algorithm where the selection process is modeled as a game.
