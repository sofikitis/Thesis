## Thesis
### Development of Recommender Systems using Game Theory Techniques

**Collaborative Filtering**, **Content Based Filtering** and **Demographic Filtering** 
recommendation methods modeled as **Cooperative Games**. 

Implementation of **Hybrid Models** combining the above methods:
  
- **Linear Combination** where each of the combined method is a player of a cooperative game.
  
- **Genetic Algorithm** where the initial population are the top-k players of Collaborative and Demographic Filtering 
  The selection process is modeled as a game.

**Results:**

- Baseline for the efficient combination of two recommendation methods, providing better results than the individual methods
- **Choice by Game:** a novelty method for the parent selection process in genetic algorithms
